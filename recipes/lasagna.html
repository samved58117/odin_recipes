    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add onion, garlic cloves, bread crumbs, egg, salt and pepper into meat.  Mix well by hand.  In a skillet cook meat mixture until no longer pink.  Pour pasta sauce into a medium size pot and bring to a boil.  Add meat to mixture and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven at 400 degrees.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/2 of the sauce mixture on bottom of a lasagna pan. On top of the sauce mixture, arrange a layer of Elena Piccola Pasta side by side and place another piece in the center of the two layers. Spread 1/2 of the Ricotta cheese over the pasta layers (stir a small amount of sauce mixture into Ricotta cheese to make it easier to spread).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle 1/2 of the grated Tolibia Romano and 1/2 of the shredded Mozzarella cheese on top of Ricotta spread.  Pour remaining sauce mixture over cheese.  Add another layer of Elena Piccola Pasta.  Spread remainder of Ricotta cheese over pasta and sprinkle remaining 1/2 of grated Romano cheese over pasta.</li>
        <li>Cover lasagna pan with aluminum foil and bake for 40 minutes.  Remove foil, turn oven to 475 degrees.  Sprinkle remaining 1/2 of shredded Mozzarella cheese evenly on top.  Bake 10 minutes or until cheese is melted and browned on the edges.  Let stand for 5 minutes before cutting the squares.</li>
